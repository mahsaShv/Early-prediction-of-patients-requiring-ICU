## Objective ##

The advent of the COVID-19 pandemic has brought an unprecedented strain on global health systems, particularly hospitals. It's become crucial to prioritize medical attention based on urgency and necessity. This dataset and the accompanying model aim to provide insights that would guide individuals in making informed decisions about seeking hospital care.

- Primary Goal: Evaluate the pre-conditions and symptoms to advise whether one should seek immediate hospital care or opt for home quarantine.

- Model's Objective: Estimate the probability of confirmed COVID-19 cases requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) support.

Many individuals, when diagnosed or suspected of having COVID-19, grapple with the decision of hospitalization or home care. By examining this dataset:

- Individuals can make smarter and more considerate decisions about seeking hospital care.
- It aids in preventing unnecessary overload on hospitals.
- Some patients critically require healthcare facilities more than others. This understanding can help streamline care to those in dire need.

## Data

The dataset, named ICUfinal.xlsx, encompasses a myriad of symptoms, travel history, and personal health records.
